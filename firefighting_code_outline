//Setup
//  Key tasks:
//    Connect motors to Arduino
//    Connect photodiode, infrared, and sonic sensors to Arduino
//    Connect pump to Arduino
//    Define thresholds for
//      Photodiode recognizing fire/not fire
//      Infrared sensors recognizing white floor/black line
//      Sonic sensor recognizing wall or obstacle/clear path
//Start up
//  Drive straight until sonic sensor detects a wall in front
//  Turn right until path is clear 
//  Go straight slowly, sonic sensor scanning to the right
//  When sonic sensor detects no obstacle, 
//Navigate
